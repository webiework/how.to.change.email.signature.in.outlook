If you want a signature to automatically show up at the bottom of your emails, you'll need to craft your signature once. Then place this into the section of Outlook settings that'll automatically apply the signature to the footer of every email you send.

1. First, open the desktop Outlook application and select File in the menu.
2. Select Options.
3. In the Outlook Options window, select Mail from the navigation pane.
4. Select the Signatures button to enter the Signatures configuration window.
5. In the Signatures and Stationery window, select New to create a new signature. Give the signature a relevant name. You can create multiple signatures. For example, create one for your personal emails and one for your work emails.
6. In the edit pane, you can create your email using a simple editor tool. This tool lets you use any font style or even import pictures into your signature if you like.
7. Under the Choose default signature section, you can use the New messages or the Replies/Forwards messages drop-down menus to select whether this signature will be used for new messages, when you reply to or forward a message, or both.
8. Select OK when you're done to save your new signature.
